Tips for Learning Programming
1. Learn and code every day, consistency is important.
2. Write it out — plan your code before you move to the computer. Take small notes.
3. Learn debugging your code — see line by line how your code works. Try it on Visual Studio.
4. Surround yourself with others who are learning. Teach to each other.
5. Learn asking GOOD questions.
   - G: Give context on what you are trying to do, clearly describing the problem.
   - O: Outline the things you have already tried to fix the issue.
   - O: Offer your best guess as to what the problem might be. This helps the person who is helping you to not only know what you are thinking, but also know that you have done some thinking on your own.
   - D: Demo what is happening. Include the code, a traceback error message, and an explanation of the steps you executed that resulted in the error. This way, the person helping does not have to try to recreate the issue.
6. Build something, anything. For example, simple calculator, or program to save and read data from TXT files.
7. Focus on 1 thing! Take small steps, but every day, consistency is very important.
